node-zwave
==========

Control your z-wave devices on node.js

THIS IS NOT READY!

This code is essentially ported from a C library that does the same thing. The C lib was written by a genius and also a close friend whose blog resides here: http://www.squarepenguin.com/wordpress/

Initially this will only support the Aeotec Z-stick device, but we will add more hardware once I get the fundamentals down.
